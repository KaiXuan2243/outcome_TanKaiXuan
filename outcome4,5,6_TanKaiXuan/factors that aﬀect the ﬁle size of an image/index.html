		 <p>
		 There are three factors that affect the file size of image. First is number of color, it have indexed color and direct color. Imdexed color means it only can store a limited of color(usually 256) controlled by the wuthor, in something called color map. And direct color can stored thousand of color that have not been directly chosen bhy author. Normally the indexed color file size can smaller than direct color. Second is file compression, also has two type that is loosy compression and lossless compression. lossy compression means the image can be compress as small as it can, maximum can compress in 100:1, normal is 10:1 or 20:1, but the cost is it will detriment quality image. While losless compression is same with lossy compression but the different is it will no detriment the quality. Next is physical pixel demension, more of pixel, better of quality image, and also the bigger file size. The last is file type. If compare JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), Gif (Graphic Interchange File Format) and PNG (Portable Network Graphic), Gif use indexed color so it possible can smaller than smaller than JPEG and PNG，but want to depending on the circumstance.
